# Cplusplus-Program
This project is a program for a grocery store, analysing data to show what products are most popular. I believe I did particularly well coding the Python portion of the project. I find Python to be quite a bit easier to use, and I feel more confident with it than C++. I think improvements can be made to most if not all of my code, as I am a beginner and have a lot to learn. I struggled a bit writing loops, as I sometimes find the syntax difficult to understand. Reviewing the zybooks chapters and asking for advice from my peers helped me immensely in this. The ability to successfully integrate multiple coding languages into one project is an important skill to have, and I know it will be useful in the future.
